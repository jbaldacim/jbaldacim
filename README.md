# About me

I'm JoÃ£o (he/him), a Systems Analysis and Development undergraduate currently pursuing a data science career. My interests include Machine Learning, Data Viz and Statistics. I've always been passionate about stories and problem solving, and I found in Data Science a field where I could work with both: every data set has a hidden story and these are the ones I want to tell.

I believe in the democratization of knowledge and I'm always up to teach what I learn.
