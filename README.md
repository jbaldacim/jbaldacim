# Hi there, I'm JoÃ£o! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Analysis and Development undergrad building a career in Software Engineering. I geek out over Front-End Development, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization â€” turning ideas into functional and beautiful solutions.

Problem-solving, storytelling, and knowledge sharing are some of my passions, so I'm always happy to share what I learn. Letâ€™s connect or collaborate!
